                Hello, <br/><br/>

                    Congrats for making it this far with the case-study course! <br/><br/>
    
                    The second part will investigate how the developed models can be used and presented in nice web platform. 
                    There is a set of functionnalities that you must implement to pass the second part. For each of one (in the menuon the left), 
                    you will find a set of guiding instructions about what is expected from your group. The freedom is left to the group to design the appropriate 
                    inetrafces as they want as long as the fucntionality is fulfilled.<br/><br/>
    
                    If you did not save pre-trained models from the first part, a set of pre-trained models can be found in the following <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/103auWjrVap1_h-zO9lUKn25LQCPbLVq1?usp=sharing">link</a>. 
                    Feel free to download the models and use them. A function returning the architecure of each of the available models can be found in the file app/nilm.py. </br></br>
    
                    If you face any problems, please feel free to drop me an E-mail. 
    
                </p>
            
                All the Best, <br/>
